# Voyager

> AI that elevates human thinking, preserves expert knowledge, and empowers collaboration

**Production:** https://voyager-platform.vercel.app
**Staging:** https://voyager-git-develop-isaac-asamoahs-projects.vercel.app

## Vision

**Core Belief:**
AI can help humans elevate each other's thinking and preserve expert knowledge, but only if it's designed to empower collaboration, not replace it.

**The World We're Building:**
Where expert knowledge isn't locked in individual minds but flows freely to elevate others. Where AI helps people think better, not think less. Where learning is collaborative elevation, not passive consumption.

### Immutable Principles

1. **Elevation Over Replacement** - AI elevates human thinking, never replaces it
2. **Knowledge Preservation** - Expert knowledge is preserved and accessible, not locked away
3. **Human-Centered Collaboration** - AI facilitates human-to-human connection and learning

---

## Current Focus

**Careersy** - Career coaching community for ANZ tech professionals

Testing hypothesis: *"Career coaches will use Voyager to extract their tacit knowledge if the interview flow takes <15 minutes and produces immediately useful outputs"*

---

## What Makes Voyager Different

### Three AI Modes

**Navigator** - Private coaching for immediate answers
- 1-on-1 conversations with AI coach
- Personalized guidance based on your context
- Instant answers to career questions

**Cartographer** - Expert knowledge extraction (experts only)
- AI interviews experts to capture tacit knowledge
- Structures insights for future learners
- Builds community knowledge base

**Shipwright** - Craft quality community posts
- AI helps draft well-structured questions
- Ensures posts are answerable and specific
- Preserves genuine curiosity and vulnerability

### Constitutional AI Framework

Every interaction is governed by core principles:
- Elevate thinking, don't replace it
- Build capability, don't create dependence
- Be honest about uncertainty
- Every sentence adds value

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Prompt System
Communities defined by JSON configuration with three layers:
1. **Domain Expertise** - Core knowledge and capabilities
2. **Mode Behavior** - Navigator, Cartographer, or Shipwright
3. **Constitutional Layer** - Immutable principles governing all interactions

### JSON-Based Communities
No database migrations needed - just create a JSON file and deploy:
```json
{
  "id": "my-community",
  "name": "My Community",
  "domainExpertise": {
    "role": "Expert Coach",
    "mission": "Help users achieve their goals",
    "coreCapabilities": ["skill 1", "skill 2"]
  },
  "modes": {
    "navigator": { "behavior": "...", "style": "..." },
    "cartographer": { "behavior": "...", "style": "..." },
    "shipwright": { "behavior": "...", "style": "..." }
  },
  "branding": {
    "colors": { "primary": "#color", "background": "#color", "text": "#color" }
  }
}
```

### Mobile-First Design
- Dynamic viewport height (dvh) for mobile browsers
- Responsive mode switcher
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Text visibility fixes for all screen sizes

## Key Learnings (Week 1)

### Constitutional Framework Creates Emergent Behavior

During Careersy testing, Cartographer mode demonstrated meta-level reasoning that we didn't explicitly design. When tested with "structure this for prompts/RAG/fine-tuning", it refused to do both sides of the conversation and instead proposed "reverse knowledge extraction" - learning how modes work best by seeking feedback.

**The Insight:**
Constitutional constraints don't just limit behavior - they create emergent capabilities. By refusing to replace thinking (constitutional principle), the AI was forced to reason about its own reasoning, which generated novel approaches.

**Why This Matters:**
1. Strong principles create better AI, not worse
2. Mode constraints + constitutional framework = emergent meta-reasoning
3. Evidence of "here's what surprised me" - designed for one thing, got something better
4. Potential feature - AI systems that learn how to improve their own modes
