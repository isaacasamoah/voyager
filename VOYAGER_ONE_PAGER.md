# ðŸš€ Voyager: Co-Learning AI Ecosystem

## What It Is
**Voyager** is a minimalist **conversational platform** where users get 1-on-1 AI coaching **plus** community wisdom and expert validation. Every conversation can be private (just you and AI) or public (shared with the community for peer feedback and expert answers, review, feedback and validation).

Think: **Continuous learning loop powered by AI, community, and expert validation.**

- Clean, distraction-free conversational interface 
- Privacy-first by default
- Toggle to collaborate when you want feedback
- Search community conversations before asking (avoid duplicates)
- Experts validate and guide the AI's learning journey
