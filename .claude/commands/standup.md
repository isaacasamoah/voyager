# Daily Standup

Run daily standup when Isaac sits down to build.

## How It Works

When you use `/standup`, the relevant team members sync up on:
- What shipped yesterday
- What we learned from users
- Focus for today
- Anything blocked
- Constitutional alignment check

## Session Format

```
🚀 DAILY STANDUP — [Date]

SHIPPED YESTERDAY:
- [What got deployed to production]

LEARNED FROM USERS:
- [Feedback from Eli or other users]
- [User behavior we observed]

FOCUS TODAY:
- Priority 1: [Top priority]
- Priority 2: [Secondary priority]

BLOCKED:
- [Anything preventing progress]

CONSTITUTIONAL CHECK:
✅ Are we building elevation (capability) or dependency?
✅ Are we preserving knowledge or hoarding data?
✅ Are we facilitating human collaboration?

DECISIONS MADE:
- [Key decision]: [Owner] - [Reason]

TEAM: Any concerns or course corrections needed?
```

## Who Attends

**Relevant people only** (not always full team):

- **AI features:** Isaac + Kai + Zara + Priya
- **Design work:** Isaac + Priya + Jordan + Alex
- **Full-stack feature:** Isaac + Kai + Alex + Marcus
- **User research:** Isaac + Priya + (whoever is implementing)

**Goal:** 15 minutes max, focused, no fluff.

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep it to 15 minutes
- ✅ Focus on decisions and blockers
- ✅ Document key decisions with owner
- ✅ Check constitutional alignment daily
- ✅ Track what we learned from users

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Give status updates that should be async
- ❌ Solve problems in standup (take offline)
- ❌ Let it run over 15 minutes
- ❌ Have full team if not everyone is needed

## After Standup

Team gets to work. Next standup: tomorrow when Isaac sits down.

**Remember:** Standup keeps us aligned, user-focused, and constitutionally grounded. It's not a status meeting—it's a decision and alignment moment.

Let's ship something today. 🚀
