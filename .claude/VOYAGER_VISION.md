# Voyager Vision Document
*Living document - refine as you learn*

---

## North Star Vision

**Core Belief:**
AI can help humans elevate each other's thinking and preserve expert knowledge, but only if it's designed to empower collaboration, not replace it.

**The World We're Building:**
Where expert knowledge isn't locked in individual minds but flows freely to elevate others. Where AI helps people think better, not think less. Where learning is a collaborative elevation, not passive consumption.

---

## Immutable Principles
*These don't change. Everything filters through this.*

### 1. Elevation Over Replacement
- AI elevates human thinking, never replaces it
- Users grow their capabilities, not their dependence
- We build copilots, not crutches

### 2. Knowledge Preservation
- Expert knowledge is preserved and accessible, not locked away
- Tacit knowledge becomes explicit and shareable
- Communities own their collective intelligence

### 3. Human-Centered Collaboration
- AI facilitates human-to-human connection and learning
- Experts are elevated, not automated away
- The goal is better humans, not better AI

### 4. [ADD YOUR FOURTH - What else is non-negotiable?]

## Decision Framework

### When User Feedback Arrives

```
USER REQUEST ──> FILTER ──> DECISION
     │              │           │
     │              │           │
  "I need X"   Immutable    Build / Don't Build
               Principles        │
                    │            │
                    ↓            ↓
            Does X align?   Document WHY
            - Elevate?      (for future you)
            - Preserve?
            - Empower?
```

### Questions to Ask (Before Building Anything)

1. **Does this elevate thinking or create dependence?**
   - If dependence → No or redesign
   - If elevation → Consider

2. **Does this preserve expert knowledge?**
   - If locks it away → No
   - If makes it accessible → Consider

3. **Does this empower collaboration?**
   - If isolates → No
   - If connects → Consider

4. **What's the REAL need behind this request?**
   - Dig deeper (be a doctor, not a waiter)
   - Solve root cause, not symptom

5. **Can I test this belief in one week?**
   - If no → slice thinner
   - If yes → ship it

## Current Focus: Careersy (Eli's Coaching Community)

### Why Careersy First?
- ✅ Real user (Eli) who's interested
- ✅ Clear value prop (his knowledge → more clients served)
- ✅ Proprietary IP (he cares about protecting it)
- ✅ Could become revenue (coaches pay for force multipliers)
- ✅ Testable in 2-3 weeks

### This Sprint's Hypothesis
**"Career coaches will use Voyager to extract their tacit knowledge if the interview flow takes <15 minutes and produces immediately useful outputs"**

---

## Ship List (Next 2-3 Weeks)
*Goal: Eli successfully uses Voyager to improve 3 client outcomes*

### Week 1: Build Core Experience
- [ ] Careersy community page (simple, mobile-first)
- [ ] Navigator mode (fix chat history, nail curator prompt)
- [ ] Cartographer mode (expert interview end-to-end)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on your phone constantly)

### Week 2: Real User Testing
- [ ] Eli onboarding session (watch him use it, take notes)
- [ ] One successful expert interview extraction (knowledge → structured output)
- [ ] He uses it with 2-3 clients (you're on call for bugs)

### Week 3: Learn & Decide
- [ ] Debrief with Eli: What worked? What broke? What did he WISH it did?
- [ ] Fix top 2 pain points from real usage
- [ ] Decision point: Double down, iterate, or pivot?

### Success Metrics
- Eli opens Voyager 3+ times without prompting
- He completes at least 1 expert interview under 15 minutes
- He voluntarily shows it to another coach
- His clients report value from the interactions

## Parking Lot
*Don't touch until Week 3 debrief. Document WHY these are parked.*

### Platform Features (Parked: Building platform before proving single use case)
- [ ] Landing page with community browsing
- [ ] Multi-community infrastructure
- [ ] Auth/invite systems beyond manual allowlist

### Voyager Developer Community (Parked: Developers critique, don't use. Need paying users first)
- [ ] Meta-community for building in public
- [ ] GitHub-style collaboration for platform development
- [ ] Training data collection from builders

### Shipwright - Collaboration Mode (Parked: Imagined complexity, no validated need yet)
- [ ] Collaboration whiteboards
- [ ] Drag-and-drop documents
- [ ] Git repo integration
- [ ] Pro plan features
- [ ] Auth for knowledge protection
**Why parked:** Designing for scale we don't have. Will know what this should be after 10 Elis use Careersy.

### Advanced Routing (Parked: Optimization before validation)
- [ ] Dynamic multi-model routing
- [ ] Automated depth detection for expert mode
- [ ] Fine-tuning pipelines
- [ ] Domain-specific model selection

### Nice-to-Haves (Parked: Not core to hypothesis)
- [ ] Depth detection automation (Eli can toggle manually for now)
- [ ] Rich text formatting
- [ ] Export features
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## Learning Questions
*What we need to learn from Eli/real usage*

### About Product
- Does curator mode feel like elevation or frustration?
- Is expert interview output immediately useful or just interesting?
- What's the actual friction point in his coaching workflow?

### About Users
- Do coaches want to preserve their knowledge?
- Will they spend 15 minutes to extract it?
- Do their clients value AI-assisted coaching?

### About Business
- Would Eli pay for this? How much?
- Who else would pay? (Coaches? Clients? Companies?)
- What's the unit of value? (Per coach? Per interaction? Subscription?)

---

## Pivot Triggers
*If these happen, reconsider approach*

1. **Eli doesn't use it after Week 2**
   - Diagnose: Wrong solution? Wrong timing? Wrong user?

2. **Expert interviews produce output Eli can't use**
   - Diagnose: Format wrong? Questions wrong? Missing something?

3. **Clients don't engage with Navigator mode**
   - Diagnose: Value prop unclear? UX too complex? Wrong mode?

4. **Eli loves it but won't pay**
   - Diagnose: Nice-to-have, not must-have. Find real pain.

---

## Future Horizons (Vision, Not Roadmap)
*Where this could go if core thesis proves true*

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- 10 career coaches using Careersy successfully
- Proven: Expert knowledge extraction works
- Revenue: First paid customers

### Mid-term (6-12 months)
- Second vertical (maybe: executive coaching, technical mentorship)
- Shipwright v1 (informed by real collaboration needs)
- Platform emerges from proven use cases

### Long-term (1-2 years)
- Multiple thriving expert communities
- AI that learns from community interactions
- Voyager becomes the layer between human expertise and AI capability

## Anthropic Story Arc
*How this builds toward your goal*

**Current:** Building in public, learning fast
**Next:** Shipped product with real users and learnings
**Then:** Deep technical exploration of human-AI collaboration
**Finally:** "Here's what I built. Here's what I learned. Here's what I want to explore with you."

---

## Reflection Prompts
*Weekly check-ins with yourself*

1. Did I ship something this week?
2. Did I learn something that changed my thinking?
3. Am I building for imagined users or real ones?
4. Am I staying true to immutable principles?
5. What's the riskiest assumption I'm making right now?
