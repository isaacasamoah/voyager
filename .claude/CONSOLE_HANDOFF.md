## üìã Immediate Action Items (Console)

### 1. **Merge to Develop**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /path/to/voyager

# Fetch latest
git fetch origin

# Checkout develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge our Anywhere work
git merge claude/debug-local-sync-011CUMF99YapxHSFfjA4uAeS

# Push to develop (you have permission from Console)
git push origin develop
```

### 2. **Run Migrations Locally**

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with new schema
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Verify schema
npx prisma studio
```

### 3. **Test Ephemeral Curate Mode**

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Toggle "Collaborate" ON in Careersy
- [ ] Post button appears immediately (no waiting for AI)
- [ ] Type: "How do I get a job at Canva?"
- [ ] AI responds with "üéØ CURATOR MODE ACTIVE" or clarifying questions
- [ ] Within 2-3 messages, AI proposes draft in TITLE:/POST:/[READY_TO_POST] format
- [ ] Click "Post" button
- [ ] Enter title if needed (or auto-parsed from TITLE:)
- [ ] Post appears in public feed
- [ ] Draft messages NOT in your conversation history (ephemeral!)

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

**Backend:**
- `app/api/conversations/create-public/route.ts` (NEW - direct post creation)
- `app/api/conversations/[id]/publish/route.ts` (smart parsing)
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` (ephemeral mode support)
- `app/api/chat-stream/route.ts` (curator prompt selection)
- `app/api/migrate/route.ts` (NEW - migration endpoint)

**Frontend:**
- `components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` (Post button, ephemeral state, publishFromDraft)
- `components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx` ([READY_TO_POST] stripping)

**Config:**
- `communities/careersy.json` (assertive curator with TITLE:/POST: format)
- `communities/voyager.json` (assertive curator)

**Database:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (curateMode, publishedPostId, isPost, contentType)
- `prisma/migrations/20251022010500_add_curate_mode/` (migration file)
- `package.json` (auto-migrations on deploy)

**Documentation:**
- `.claude/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md` (Console vs Anywhere permissions)
- `.claude/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (previous session notes)
- `EPHEMERAL_DRAFTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (implementation details)

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Edge Cases

None identified yet! This is the first test.

**Watch for:**
- Migration errors (Prisma client generation)
- Curator not activating (check curateMode passed to APIs)
- Post button not appearing (check mode === 'public')
- Parsing errors (TITLE:/POST: format)

---

## üîÑ Going Forward

### **From Console (Recommended):**
Work directly on `develop`:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
# ... work ...
git push origin develop
```

### **From Anywhere/Browser:**
Claude will use `claude/*` branches:
```bash
# Work happens on claude/session-xyz
# Push to claude/session-xyz ‚úÖ
# Later merge from Console to develop
```

See `.claude/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md` for full details.

- `.claude/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Previous session context
- `.claude/FUTURE_FEATURES.md` - Community creation via curate mode (future)
- `EPHEMERAL_DRAFTING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation details

## üéØ Success Criteria

**You'll know it's working when:**
1. Post button visible immediately when Collaborate ON
2. Curator says "üéØ CURATOR MODE ACTIVE"
3. Curator proposes draft within 2-3 messages
4. Draft uses TITLE:/POST:/[READY_TO_POST] format
5. Clicking Post publishes to community feed
6. Draft messages don't appear in private conversation history

---

## üöÄ Next Features (After Testing)

Once ephemeral curate mode is verified working:

1. **Visual distinction for Posts vs Comments**
   - Posts: Full-width cards, larger text
   - Comments: Nested, smaller

2. **Public feed enhancements**
   - Show isPost prominently
   - Better visual hierarchy

3. **Community creation via curate mode** (see FUTURE_FEATURES.md)
   - Use curator to help experts create new communities
   - contentType: "community" triggers interview flow

---

**All set for Console!** Everything is committed, pushed, and documented. Just merge to develop and test! üöÄ
