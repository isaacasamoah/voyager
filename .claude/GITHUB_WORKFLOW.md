# GitHub Workflow - Multi-Environment Development

**Branch Strategy:** `develop` as single source of truth with environment-specific permissions

---

## Environment Permissions

### **Claude Code Console/Desktop** (Full Access)
- ‚úÖ Can push to ANY branch (`develop`, `main`, feature branches)
- ‚úÖ Full git permissions
- ‚úÖ Recommended: Work directly on `develop`

### **Claude Code Anywhere (Browser)** (Restricted)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can ONLY push to `claude/*` branches
- ‚ùå Cannot push to `develop`, `main`, or other branches (403 error)
- üîí Security feature to prevent unintended changes
- ‚úÖ Use `claude/*` branches, merge to `develop` later from Console

---

## Branch Structure

```
main (production, protected)
  ‚Üë
  ‚îî‚îÄ merge from develop when releasing

develop (source of truth for active development)
  ‚Üë
  ‚îú‚îÄ claude/session-* (Anywhere sessions, merge manually from Console)
  ‚îú‚îÄ feature/* (short-lived features)
  ‚îî‚îÄ fix/* (bug fixes)
```

---

## Workflow by Environment

### **Console/Desktop Sessions** (Recommended Primary Workflow)

```bash
# Start Session
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Work directly on develop
# ... make changes ...

# Commit frequently
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: description"

# Push to develop (you have permission)
git push origin develop
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, direct
- No merge needed
- Always synced

**Use this for:** Your primary development work

---

### **Anywhere/Browser Sessions** (Feature Branches)

Claude Code Anywhere will automatically create `claude/*` branches:

```bash
# Start Session (Claude does this)
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
# Claude creates: claude/debug-local-sync-011CUMF99YapxHSFfjA4uAeS

# Work happens on claude/* branch
# ... changes ...

# Push to claude/* branch (allowed)
git push origin claude/debug-local-sync-011CUMF99YapxHSFfjA4uAeS  # ‚úÖ

# Cannot push to develop (permission denied)
git push origin develop  # ‚ùå 403 error
```

**To sync this work to develop:**
```bash
# Later, from Console/Desktop:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge claude/debug-local-sync-011CUMF99YapxHSFfjA4uAeS
git push origin develop
```

**Use this for:** Quick edits from mobile/browser, experimental work

---

## Common Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Switching Environments**

**From Mobile ‚Üí Laptop:**
```bash
# On laptop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# You now have all the work you did on mobile!
```

### **Scenario 2: Multiple People Working**

**Isaac pushed to develop while you were working:**
```bash
# You're on feature branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop  # Get Isaac's changes

# Merge develop into your feature branch
git checkout <your-feature-branch>
git merge develop  # Brings Isaac's changes into your branch

# Resolve conflicts if any, then continue working
```

### **Scenario 3: Long-Running Feature**

**Feature will take multiple sessions:**
```bash
# Session 1
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/long-feature
# ... work ...
git push origin feature/long-feature

# Session 2 (next day)
git checkout feature/long-feature
git pull origin feature/long-feature
# ... continue work ...

# When complete
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge feature/long-feature
git push origin develop
```

---

## Branch Naming Conventions

- `claude/session-*` - Auto-created by Claude Code (ephemeral)
- `feature/<name>` - New features (e.g., `feature/curate-mode`)
- `fix/<name>` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/auth-redirect`)
- `docs/<name>` - Documentation only (e.g., `docs/api-guide`)

---

## Important Rules

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Always start by pulling develop
- Always end by merging back to develop
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Push to origin often (backup your work)
- Delete feature branches after merging

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Push broken code to develop (test first!)
- Work on main branch directly (use develop)
- Force push to develop or main
- Leave unmerged feature branches for more than a week

---

## Quick Reference

**Start Session:**
```bash
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
```

**End Session:**
```bash
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git merge <feature-branch> && git push origin develop
```

**Check Status:**
```bash
git status
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate | head -20
```

**See What's on Remote:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git branch -r
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### **"I forgot to merge to develop and started a new session"**

You now have diverged branches. Fix:
```bash
# Get both branches
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

git checkout <old-feature-branch>
git pull origin <old-feature-branch>

# Merge old work into develop
git checkout develop
git merge <old-feature-branch>
git push origin develop
```

### **"I have merge conflicts"**

```bash
# See conflicted files
git status

# Edit files to resolve conflicts (look for <<<<<<)
# Then:
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts"
git push origin develop
```

### **"Which branch am I on?"**

```bash
git branch  # Shows all local branches, * = current
git status  # Shows current branch and changes
```

## Integration with Claude Code

**Claude Code automatically:**
- Creates session-specific branches (e.g., `claude/debug-local-sync-011CUMF99YapxHSFfjA4uAeS`)
- Commits with descriptive messages
- Pushes to origin

**You need to manually:**
- Merge back to develop at end of session
- Pull from develop at start of session

**Tip:** Add this to your session start routine:
1. Read `.claude/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (if exists)
2. `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop`
3. Start working
