# Session Summary - Curate Mode Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Branch:** `claude/debug-local-sync-011CUMF99YapxHSFfjA4uAeS`
**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting for Vercel build to complete

---

## What We Built Today

### ‚úÖ Completed Features:

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `curateMode` (Boolean) to Conversation
   - Added `publishedPostId` (String?) to Conversation
   - Added `contentType` (String, default: "message") to Conversation
   - Added `isPost` (Boolean) to Message
   - Migration file: `prisma/migrations/20251022010500_add_curate_mode/`

2. **Curator Prompts in Community Configs**
   - `communities/voyager.json` ‚Üí added `aiPrompts.curator.message`
   - `communities/careersy.json` ‚Üí added `aiPrompts.curator.message`
   - Maintains backward compatibility with `customPrompt`

3. **Chat API Updates**
   - `app/api/chat/route.ts` ‚Üí accepts `curateMode` parameter
   - `app/api/chat-stream/route.ts` ‚Üí accepts `curateMode` parameter
   - Both select curator vs coach prompt based on `curateMode` flag
   - Exclude resume context in curator mode

4. **UI Wiring**
   - `components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` ‚Üí passes `curateMode: true` when Collaborate toggle is ON
   - Wired to both streaming and save API calls

5. **Publish Endpoint** (Created but not yet tested)
   - `app/api/conversations/[id]/publish/route.ts`
   - Takes draft conversation, creates new public conversation with final message
   - Links via `publishedPostId`

6. **Migration Automation**
   - Updated `package.json` ‚Üí `"postinstall": "prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy"`
   - Created `/api/migrate` endpoint for mobile testing
   - **Auto-migrations now run on every Vercel deploy**
   - Documented in `docs/operations.md`

## Current State

### Build Status:
- **Latest commit:** `2aae266` - "fix(publish): declare session outside try block"
- **Vercel:** Currently building (should succeed this time)
- **Migration:** Will run automatically during this build via `postinstall` script

### What Happens When Build Completes:
1. ‚úÖ TypeScript compiles successfully
2. ‚úÖ `prisma generate` creates types
3. ‚úÖ `prisma migrate deploy` applies curate mode migration to Neon database
4. ‚úÖ Deployment succeeds
5. üéØ **Ready to test curator mode!**

---

## Testing Instructions (Once Build Succeeds)

### 1. Find Your Preview URL
Format: `https://careersy-wingman-git-claude-debug-local-sync-011cumf99yapxhsffjA4uAeS-[team].vercel.app`

Check:
- GitHub PR/commit status
- Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments

### 2. Test Curator Mode in Careersy
1. Go to Careersy community
2. Toggle **"Collaborate" ON** (should turn yellow/primary color)
3. Type: "I need help with my resume"
4. **Expected:** AI asks clarifying questions like:
   - "What specific aspect of your career?"
   - "What have you already tried?"
   - "What's your experience level?"
5. **Not Expected:** AI directly helps with resume (that's coach mode)

### 3. Test Curator Mode in Voyager
Same test - verify it works across communities

### 4. Verify Auto-Migration
Check Vercel build logs:
- Should see `prisma migrate deploy` running
- Should see "Migrations completed successfully"

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Microfeatures)

### 1. Add "Post to Community" Button
- Show button in curated draft conversations
- Calls `/api/conversations/:id/publish`
- Shows success state when published

### 2. Update Public Feed Display
- Show published posts prominently
- Mark first message as "Post" vs subsequent as "Comments"
- Different visual treatment

### 3. Visual Distinction (Posts vs Comments)
- Post cards: Full-width, larger, metadata
- Comment cards: Indented/nested, smaller

### 4. End-to-End Test
- Toggle Collaborate ON
- Draft a post with AI (multi-turn refinement)
- Click "Post to Community"
- Verify appears in public feed
- Verify draft stays private

## Important Context

### Database Setup:
- **Database:** Neon Postgres (external, not Vercel-hosted)
- **URL:** `ep-orange-flower-a71hpnkp-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech`
- **Previous migrations:** Were run manually
- **Going forward:** Run automatically on deploy

### Collaborate Toggle Behavior:
- **OFF (Private mode):** AI = coach (instant answers, uses resume context)
- **ON (Curate mode):** AI = curator (asks clarifying questions, helps craft posts)

### Design Decisions:
- Curator prompts stored in community configs (git-versioned)
- Draft conversations stay private (only polished message goes public)
- Publish creates NEW public conversation (clean separation)
- Future-proof for file/code/whiteboard curating (contentType field)

## If Build Fails Again

Check for:
1. TypeScript errors in Vercel logs
2. Migration errors (DATABASE_URL set?)
3. Prisma client generation issues

Quick fix options:
1. Revert last commit if needed
2. Use `/api/migrate?key=voyager-migrate-2025` endpoint manually
3. Check this session summary for context

---

## When You Return

1. **Check build status** - Did it succeed?
2. **Test curator mode** - Does collaborate toggle work?
3. **Verify migration** - Check build logs
4. **Continue with next microfeature** - Add "Post to Community" button
