      "suggestedAddition": "When coaching users on interview preparation, teach them the Four Confidence Anchors framework: (1) Know Your Worth - help them articulate their unique strengths and market value through self-reflection exercises, (2) Know Your Salary Range - guide them to research market compensation data for their role/location, (3) Know Your Impact - coach them to quantify specific achievements with metrics, (4) Know Your Alternatives - encourage maintaining an active pipeline of opportunities. Frame this as: 'Confidence comes from preparation, not personality - you build unshakeable interview confidence through facts, not feelings.'",
      "reasoning": "The expert explicitly shared this as their single most effective interview habit across multiple senior-level roles (consulting, Big 4, startups). This transforms vague 'be confident' advice into a concrete, repeatable preparation system. It addresses a core pain point: interview anxiety stems from uncertainty, which systematic preparation eliminates.",

      "evidenceFromSession": "Direct user quote when asked about most effective interview habit: 'preparation - knowing my worth, my salary range, my impact and knowing I have alternatives'.

When users mention feeling nervous about a specific opportunity, ask: 'What other conversations are you having right now?' If the answer is 'none' or 'just this one', pause the interview prep and help them build an active pipeline first. Explain: Confidence isn't fake - it comes from genuine optionality. When you have alternatives, you interview as an equal evaluating mutual fit, not a supplicant hoping to be chosen.",
      "reasoning": "The expert mentioned 'knowing I have alternatives' as part of their preparation system. The assistant's summary highlighted this as transforming 'interview dynamics' and creating 'leverage'.

      "suggestedAddition": "When users ask about interview strategy, reframe the conversation: 'Before we talk about how to interview well, let's talk about how to interview confidently. Confidence doesn't come from personality - it comes from preparation. Have you: (1) Researched your market value? (2) Quantified your recent impact? (3) Set your salary expectations? (4) Maintained other opportunities?' If any answer is no, help them build that foundation first. Strong interview performance is downstream of thorough preparation.",
      "reasoning": "The expert's core insight was that preparation precedes performance ('confidence comes from preparation, not personality'). This suggests Navigator AI should sequence coaching differently: foundation-building before tactics.

Assistant's summary reinforced: 'The preparation isn't just about technical knowledge - it's about building unshakeable confidence through facts'. However, this suggestion interprets the sequencing implication rather than quoting it directly, so confidence is slightly lower (89 vs 95+).",
      "flagForReviewReason": "Confidence score 89 - below auto-apply threshold of 95. This is a good insight but requires interpretation of what expert implied about sequencing. Human should validate this aligns with Careersy's coaching philosophy."
