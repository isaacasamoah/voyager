# Experiment: [Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** [Who's running this experiment]
**Type:** [Frontend / Backend / ML / Design / Product / Operations]
**Status:** [Active / Completed / Archived]

---

## Hypothesis

**What are we testing?**

[Clear, specific statement of what you think will happen]

**Example:** "Animated mode transitions will reduce cognitive load and users will prefer them over instant switches."

---

## Success Criteria

**How will we know if this worked?**

[Measurable, specific criteria]

**Examples:**
- User testing shows 80%+ preference for animated version
- Eval score improves by 10%+
- Response time decreases by 100ms
- 5/5 user interviews validate the need

---

## Timeline

**How long will this take?**

- **Start date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Expected completion:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Total time:** X days

---

## Implementation Plan

**What are you building/testing?**

[Brief description of what you'll create]

**Steps:**
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [etc.]

---

## Resources Needed

**What do you need to run this experiment?**

- [ ] Team member collaboration (who?)
- [ ] Tools/services (Figma, API access, etc.)
- [ ] Time estimate (hours/days)
- [ ] Budget (if any costs involved)

---

## Results

**What happened?**

[Fill this out as you go and at completion]

### Metrics/Data

[Quantitative results - numbers, percentages, measurements]

**Example:**
- Eval score: Before 72%, After 81% (+9%)
- User preference: 8/10 users preferred new version
- Performance: Response time reduced from 450ms to 380ms

### Observations

[Qualitative insights - what did you notice?]

**Example:**
- Users commented that animations felt "smooth" and "professional"
- Two users found animations distracting
- Mobile performance suffered (animations laggy on older devices)

### Screenshots/Evidence

[Link to screenshots, recordings, data exports]

## Learnings

**What did we learn?**

### What Worked
- [Thing that worked and why]
- [Another success]

### What Didn't Work
- [Thing that failed and why]
- [Another failure]

### Surprises
- [Unexpected finding]
- [Something that surprised you]

---

## Decision

**What happens next?**

- [ ] **Ship to Production** - Move to feature branch, refactor, merge to develop
- [ ] **Iterate** - Continue experimenting with modifications
- [ ] **Archive** - Didn't work, document and move on
- [ ] **Park** - Interesting but not now, revisit later

**Reasoning:**

[Explain why you made this decision]

---

## Decision Funnel Checklist

**If shipping to production, complete this:**

- [ ] **Met success criteria** - Results match or exceed what we defined
- [ ] **Priya validates user need** - Real user problem being solved
- [ ] **Domain expert approves** - Kai/Zara/Jordan/Alex/Marcus/Nadia reviewed
- [ ] **Constitutional alignment** - Elevates users, preserves knowledge, facilitates collaboration
- [ ] **Team consensus** (if major change) - Full team discussed and approved
- [ ] **Refactored for production** - Code is production-quality, tested, documented
- [ ] **Feature branch created** - Code moved from lab to feature/[name]

---

## Next Steps

**If shipping:**
1. [Create feature branch]
2. [Refactor code]
3. [Write tests]
4. [Create PR to develop]

**If iterating:**
1. [What to change]
2. [What to test next]

**If archiving:**
1. [Move to .lab/archive/]
2. [Share learnings with team]
