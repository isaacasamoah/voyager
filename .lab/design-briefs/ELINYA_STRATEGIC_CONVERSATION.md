## THREE STRATEGIC AREAS ELINYA WANTS TO EXPLORE

### 1. Supportive Income Streams (Personal + Corporate)

**Her Question:**
"How to generate the most supportive income streams from Voyager and its plugins, while delivering a really satisfying experience for customers of personal and corporate type?"

**What We Have (as of this session):**
- B2B2C model (community builders → members)
- Growth-aligned revenue share (5% → 50%)
- $18.99/month member pricing
- Personal/community focus (career coaching, etc.)

**What's Unexplored:**
- Corporate use cases
- Different pricing for corporate vs personal?
- Different features for corporate customers?
- Plugin revenue models
- What "supportive" means in detail

**Team Response:**
- Nadia: Does the model *feel* fair? Would you pay $18.99/month?
- Marcus: Corporate could be different tier or separate product
- Need to validate with Elinya's intuitive lens

### 2. Marketing for Rapid, Stable Growth

**Her Question:**
"How best to market Voyager for rapid and stable growth that supports Isaac's vision?"

**Current GTM Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Pilot with Eli (10K Careersy community)
- Phase 2: 100K community win
- Phase 3: Multiple communities (ecosystem play)

**What Elinya Could Help With:**
- Marketing messaging (does it resonate?)
- Growth channels (where to find community builders?)
- Brand positioning (how to stand out?)
- Stability vs speed balance

**Team Response:**
- Priya: Eager to get consumer perspective on positioning
- Nadia: Marketing strategy unexplored territory for us
- Jordan: First-impression feedback crucial for messaging

### 3. Sister App for Entrepreneurs (Vision → Reality)

**Her Idea:**
"A sister-app for Voyager that would help people bring their entrepreneur vision into reality."

**Questions to Explore:**
- How does it fit Voyager's vision?
- Integration with Voyager subscription structures?
- Clean integration technically?
- Separate app or Voyager mode?

**Team Response:**

**Kai (Technical):**
- Shared infrastructure = low marginal cost
- "Voyager for X" model possible
- Modular prompts + RAG make domain variants easy

**Marcus (Economics):**
- Shared infrastructure, separate positioning
- Different audience = expand TAM, not cannibalize
- Cross-sell potential

**Zara (Constitutional Alignment):**
- Elevation (help execute, don't do it for them) ✅
- Preservation (capture founder journey) ✅
- Collaboration (could entrepreneur communities live on Voyager?)

**Alex (UX):**
- Option A: Unified platform with "Career" and "Entrepreneur" modes
- Option B: Separate apps with integration
- Which *feels* right to Elinya?

**Priya (Product):**
- Need more detail on what "vision → reality" means
- User journey? Use cases? Target customer?
