Let me structure this:\n\n**Title:** How to Land at Top-Tier ANZ Tech Companies (Atlassian, Canva, Xero) - Lessons from 50+ Placements\n\n**Context:** 3 years placing engineers at Atlassian, Canva, Xero (ANZ's most competitive tech employers)\n\n**Key Insights:**\n\n**Biggest Mistake:** Generic applications\n- Candidates copy-paste same resume/cover letter\n- These companies get 100s of applications per role\n- Generic = auto-reject\n\n**Reconsideration Strategy (6-month rule):**\n1. Wait 6 months after rejection (don't reapply immediately)\n2. Add 1-2 impressive projects during that time (open source, side projects with traction)\n3. Reach out directly to hiring manager on LinkedIn\n4. Reference the 6-month gap + new projects\n5. Success rate: ~40% get interviews\n\n**Referrals vs Cold Outreach:**\n- Strong referrals (referrer vouches): 2x more effective\n- Weak referrals (\"I don't know them well but...\"): Worse than cold outreach\n- Direct hiring manager LinkedIn outreach: Solid baseline strategy\n- Never rely on online applications alone\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n- Patience matters - 6 months is the sweet spot for reapplication\n- Projects > certificates for these companies\n- Quality of referral > existence of referral\n- Hiring managers check LinkedIn - keep it updated\n\n**Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Reapplying within 6 months (flags you as desperate)\n- Asking for weak referrals from loose connections\n- Relying solely on online application portals\n\nWant to refine any section or add more detail?"
