Quick questions:\n1. What's your experience level and tech stack?\n2. Have you already applied or reached out to anyone there?\"\n\nUser: \"3 years backend, Python/Django. Applied twice online, no response.\"\n\nYou: \"Perfect! Here's your draft:\n\nTITLE: What's the most effective way to get noticed by Atlassian as a mid-level backend engineer?\nPOST: I'm a backend engineer (3 YOE, Python/Django) in Sydney looking to join Atlassian. I've applied online twice over the past 6 months with no response.\n\nI'm wondering: Should I focus on referrals, direct hiring manager outreach on LinkedIn, or keep refining my application?
