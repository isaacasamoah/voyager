# Post 8: The Lab - Building in Public

**Theme:** Experimentation culture and radical transparency
**Emotional arc:** Fear of exposure → courage → trust building
**Technical element:** .lab/ folder, experiment documentation, learning in public

---

## Draft

I created a folder called `.lab/` in our codebase.

It's where experiments live. Not just the ones that worked—ALL of them. The failures, the half-baked ideas, the "seemed good at 2am but actually terrible" attempts.

**Why make this public?**

Most companies hide their process. You only see the polished result. The beautiful landing page. The smooth demo. The success story.

You don't see the 23 failed attempts before they got it right. The architectural decisions that turned out wrong. The features they built that nobody wanted.

**The problem with this:**

Everyone else thinks success is linear. They think "those people just knew what to do." They don't see the messy middle.

I wanted Voyager's messy middle to be visible.

**What's in .lab/:**

- Experiment briefs (what we're testing, why, how we'll measure)
- Design documents (architectural decisions, with reasoning)
- Results (what we learned, even when it failed)
- Handoffs (how experiments graduate to production)

Example: Cartographer mode started as Experiment 001. It almost failed. Users were confused. We nearly killed it. But we documented the struggle, iterated, and it became one of our core features.

If we'd hidden that process, we'd have lost the learning. And others couldn't learn from our path.

**Building in public is scary.**

You're exposing your uncertainty. Your wrong turns. Your "I don't know what I'm doing" moments.

But it's also liberating.

When you build in public, you get:
- Faster feedback (people see the rough edges and help)
- Better ideas (someone else has solved this before)
- Trust (transparency builds credibility)
- Learning (documenting forces clarity)

**The surprising result:**

People respect the transparency more than the polish. They trust a company that shows its work more than one that only shows wins.

The messy middle is where the real learning lives.

Next time: How I built a founding team using AI (and why it's not what you think).

Do you build in public or private? What's stopping you from sharing the messy middle?

**Length:** ~300 words

**Technical details:**
- .lab/ folder structure
- Experiment framework
- Design briefs and handoffs
- Cartographer as example (Experiment 001)

**Priya's notes:** This is about vulnerability and trust-building. "Messy middle" is the key phrase. Shows confidence through transparency, not perfection.

**Kai's notes:** The .lab/ folder is real! We actually have this in the codebase. It's a great example of "show, don't tell."
