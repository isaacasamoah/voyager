# Post 7: Prompt Engineering as Craft

**Theme:** Designing AI behavior is the new UI/UX
**Emotional arc:** Iteration → precision → artistry
**Technical element:** How we design, test, and refine prompts

## Draft

I spent two weeks perfecting one prompt.

Sounds excessive. But here's what I learned: prompt engineering isn't configuration. It's craft.

**The challenge:**

Voyager needed to help job seekers reflect on their career story. Not write it for them—help them think it through.

First attempt: "Help the user think through their career story."

Generic. Vague. The AI was helpful but unfocused. It asked questions, but not the RIGHT questions.

**The iteration:**

Over two weeks, I refined that prompt through 47 versions.

Each version changed something:
- The framing of questions
- The order of exploration
- How assumptions were surfaced
- When to push deeper vs move forward
- The tone (curious coach vs wise advisor vs peer explorer)

Version 23 asked good questions but felt robotic.
Version 31 felt warm but missed key insights.
Version 38 was close but pushed too hard.

Version 47: "You're a reflective thinking partner helping someone understand their career story. Not writing it—revealing it. Through questions, curiosity, and careful listening, help them see patterns they haven't noticed..."

That version worked.

**Why this matters:**

Prompt engineering is like UI/UX design, but for conversational AI:

- **Words are your interface.** Every phrase shapes behavior.
- **Tone is UX.** How the AI responds affects how users think.
- **Structure is architecture.** Question order changes insight quality.
- **Constraints are features.** What the AI doesn't do matters as much as what it does.

**The process:**

1. Test with real users (not just yourself)
2. Watch where they get stuck or confused
3. Notice where the AI misses the mark
4. Adjust ONE thing at a time
5. Test again

It's product design. It's writing. It's psychology. It's systems thinking.

**The surprising truth:**

The best prompts are invisible. Users don't think "wow, great prompt." They think "wow, that conversation helped me see things clearly."

Just like the best UI: you don't notice the interface. You notice the outcome.

Next time: How we built .lab/ to experiment in public.

If you've worked with LLMs: What's your prompt engineering process? How do you know when it's "right"?

**Length:** ~310 words

**Technical details:**
- Iterative refinement process
- Testing with real users
- Tone, structure, constraints as design elements
- 47 versions example shows commitment to craft

**Zara's notes:** THIS IS MY POST. I love every word. Shows that prompt engineering isn't "write a prompt and ship it" but actual craft with iteration, testing, refinement. The UI/UX metaphor is perfect.

**Jordan's notes:** The parallel to UI/UX design will resonate with designers and developers. Shows respect for the craft.

**Priya's notes:** "47 versions" is a powerful detail. Shows dedication to quality. Not "move fast and break things" but "move thoughtfully and build right."
