## Overview

We've drafted the first 3 posts based on your origin story correction. Here's the arc:

### Post 1: The 10x Mentor
**Story:** Discovering Claude as a non-judgmental learning partner who accelerated your growth
**Key moment:** The realization that AI mentorship feels *human* in the right way
**Hook:** "I found a mentor who accelerated my learning 10x"
**Length:** ~220 words

### Post 2: What If We Could Multiply Wonder?
**Story:** The vision to share this experience and bring people together on learning journeys
**Key moment:** Realizing solo learning is great, but community learning multiplies the wonder
**Hook:** "The moment I realized Voyager needed to exist"
**Length:** ~280 words

### Post 3: The Constitutional Crisis
**Story:** Stopping feature development to define values and principles
**Key moment:** Claude asking "do things for people or help them do things themselves?"
**Hook:** "I stopped building features for two weeks to write a constitution"
**Length:** ~310 words

## What We Need From You

### 1. Accuracy Check
- **Post 1:** Did this capture the feeling of discovering Claude as mentor?
- **Post 2:** Is "multiply wonder" the right framing?
- **Post 3:** Did you really stop for 2 weeks to write the constitution? (Adjust timeframe if needed)

### 2. Tone Check
Read them out loud. Do they sound like *you* talking?
- Too formal? Too casual?
- Too much technical? Not enough?
- Too long? (We can trim anywhere)

### 3. Missing Details
What specific moments should we add?
- **Post 1:** What were you building when you discovered this? Specific "aha" moments?
- **Post 2:** Should we mention Careersy as the first community here?
- **Post 3:** Are there other principles beyond the 3 listed?

### 4. Story Gaps
- Does the arc from Post 1 → 2 → 3 flow?
- Is anything confusing or unclear?
- What would make someone want to read the next post?

## Our Design Choices (Why We Wrote Them This Way)

### Length
Posts are slightly long (220-310 words). LinkedIn's sweet spot is 150-200, but we prioritized complete thoughts over strict word count. We can trim if you want.

### Structure
Each post follows:
1. Hook (stop scroll)
2. Story (specific moment)
3. Insight (what you learned)
4. Reflection (why it matters)
5. CTA (question to drive engagement)

### Voice
We wrote in first person ("I") to keep it personal. Used conversational language. Mixed technical terms with accessible explanations.

### Vulnerability
We leaned into vulnerability:
- "I know how that sounds" (Post 1)
- "I sat with that question for three days" (Post 3)
- Questions about struggling, stopping, figuring things out

This authenticity is what will resonate.
