## Writing Guidelines

**Do:**
- ✅ Start with a hook (stop the scroll)
- ✅ Tell a specific story (not generic)
- ✅ Share what you learned
- ✅ Be vulnerable about struggles
- ✅ Include technical details
- ✅ End with reflection or question

**Don't:**
- ❌ Humblebrag
- ❌ Generic "AI is the future" content
- ❌ Product pitch
- ❌ Hide failures

**Voice:**
- Write like Isaac talks (conversational, thoughtful, curious)
- Use "I" not "we" (personal journey)
- Technical depth but accessible
- Reflective, not prescriptive
