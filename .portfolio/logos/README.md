## Design Philosophy

**Honeycomb Metaphor:**
- Half-open top = Work in progress, built by community
- Interior lines = Structure, foundation being built
- Multiple cells = Extensibility, many communities

**Space-Age Aesthetic:**
- Clean geometric shapes
- Monochromatic (can add community accent colors)
- Brutally functional
- Timeless, not trendy

**Versatility:**
- Works at any size (favicon to billboard)
- Works in color or monochrome
- Works with or without wordmark
- Scales across all communities

## Color Palette

**Primary:**
- Deep Space: `#0a0a0f` or `#1a1a2e`
- Pure White: `#ffffff`

**Accent (Community-specific):**
- Careersy: `#fad02c` (warm gold)
- Future communities: Custom colors

**Philosophy:** Logo is monochrome, communities add their color accent

## Next Steps

1. **Isaac reviews** - Which direction feels right?
2. **Refine chosen direction** - Adjust proportions, weights
3. **Create full system:**
   - Favicon (16x16, 32x32, 180x180)
   - App icons (iOS, Android sizes)
   - Social media (1200x630, 1024x512)
   - Print-ready (vector, high-res)
4. **Apply to Voyager** - Update branding across platform
