# Cartographer Mode - Extract Your Expertise

Turn your tacit coaching knowledge into structured documentation. 10-15 minutes.

## Quick Start

1. **Click "Cartographer"** in the mode switcher (top of chat)
2. **Start a conversation** - Tell Cartographer what you want to document
3. **Answer 5-7 questions** - AI interviews you, pulls out specifics
4. **Get structured output** - Copy/paste the documentation

## Example

**You:** "I want to document my framework for helping clients transition from corporate to consulting"

**Cartographer interviews you:**
- "Walk me through the first session with a corporate-to-consulting client"
- "What's the biggest mistake they make in month 1?"
- "What metrics tell you they're ready to quit their job?"

**Output:** Structured doc with your framework, timelines, red flags, success metrics.

## Tips

- **Be specific** - "3 months" beats "several months", "20% revenue drop" beats "significant drop"
- **Talk like you're coaching** - Cartographer pulls patterns from how you naturally explain things
- **One topic per session** - "Client onboarding" not "everything I know about career coaching"
- **Save the output** - Copy/paste into your notes, Notion, wherever

## When to Use Cartographer

- After coaching 3+ clients on the same issue (you've developed a pattern)
- Before a workshop (extract your framework to teach it)
- End of month (capture what you learned)

---

**That's it.** Toggle to Cartographer, have a conversation, get documentation.
