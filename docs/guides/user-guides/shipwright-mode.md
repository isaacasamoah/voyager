# Shipwright Mode - Craft Quality Posts

Write community posts that help others think, not just answer questions.

## Quick Start

1. **Click "Shipwright"** in the mode switcher (top of chat)
2. **Draft your post** - Tell Shipwright what you want to share
3. **Get feedback** - AI helps you sharpen the thinking
4. **Publish** - Post to the community feed

## Example

**You:** "I want to share my thoughts on why most people fail at networking"

**Shipwright helps you:**
- Turn vague opinion into specific insight
- Add a real example or story
- Frame it as something readers can act on
- Make sure it teaches, not preaches

## Tips

- **Lead with insight** - What did you learn that surprised you?
- **One clear point** - Not "here are 10 networking tips", but "this one thing changed how I network"
- **Help others think** - Best posts make readers say "I never thought about it that way"

## Why Shipwright?

Community posts stick around. Make them worth reading.

**That's it.** Draft, refine, publish.
