## What Shipwright Does

**Shipwright teaches through doing.**

Instead of just talking about what makes good writing, Shipwright helps you create it through back-and-forth refinement. You learn craft skills by practicing them.

---

## What You Can Refine

Shipwright works with three types of artifacts:

### 📝 Messages 📋 COMING SOON
Draft messages ready to send (emails, Slack posts, LinkedIn updates)

**Example:**
- You: "Help me write a recruiter email"
- Shipwright asks what your main goal is
- Together you refine until it feels right
- Copy → Send

*Note: Currently in design phase. Use Navigator mode for message drafting.*

---

### 📄 Documents ✅ AVAILABLE NOW
Polish uploaded files (resumes, cover letters, proposals)

**Features:**
- Two-pane interface: Chat with Shipwright + Live preview/editor
- **AI Edit Mode**: Conversational refinement with live updates
- **Manual Edit Mode**: Direct editing with CodeMirror markdown editor
- Version tracking with one-level undo
- Real-time preview as you chat or edit
- Save changes to your Context Anchor

**Example:**
- Upload your resume as a Context Anchor
- Click to edit with Shipwright (opens modal)
- "Tailor this for the Sophie role"
- Shipwright suggests improvements with rationale
- Switch to manual edit mode if you want to type directly
- Watch live preview update as AI or you make changes
- Save when ready → Export as PDF → Submit

---

### 🎨 Whiteboards 📋 COMING SOON
Clarify ideas through visual thinking (brainstorms, flows, wireframes)

**Example:**
- "Help me map out this feature"
- Shipwright asks about user goals
- Together you build the flow with sticky notes and arrows
- When you can explain it to a 5-year-old, the idea is clear
- Save or export for your team

*Note: Visual collaboration mode in design phase. For now, use document mode for text-based brainstorming.*

---

## How It Works

**1. You bring the start state**
- A rough idea
- An uploaded document
- A goal to explore

**2. Shipwright refines with you**
- Asks clarifying questions
- Makes specific suggestions
- Shows changes in real-time
- Explains WHY when it helps you learn

**3. You decide when it's ready**
- Messages: Ready to send
- Documents: Ready to submit
- Whiteboards: Idea is clear (5-year-old test)

## What Makes Shipwright Different

### vs Navigator (Questioning)
**Navigator** helps you think through problems by asking questions.
**Shipwright** helps you create artifacts by editing together.

### vs Cartographer (Conversation)
**Cartographer** extracts your knowledge through interview.
**Shipwright** refines your work through collaborative editing.

## Tips for Great Sessions

**Start with something**
Don't ask Shipwright to write from scratch. Bring a rough draft, an idea, or an uploaded document.

**Make decisions**
When Shipwright suggests changes, say yes/no/maybe. You're in control.

**Ask "why" when it helps**
"Why did you phrase it this way?" → Learn transferable principles

**Iterate quickly**
Short back-and-forth beats long explanations. Doing teaches faster than hearing.

**Know when you're done**
- Messages: Would you send this?
- Documents: Would you submit this?
- Whiteboards: Can you explain this simply?

## Example Session (Resume Editing)

```
You: "Tailor my resume for this PM role"

Shipwright: "Let's highlight your product experience.
Which projects show customer impact?"

You: "The checkout redesign increased conversion 15%"

Shipwright: "Perfect. Here's a stronger bullet:
'Led checkout redesign that increased conversion 15% (500K additional revenue)'
Does that feel right?"

You: "Yes, but simpler"

Shipwright: "'Redesigned checkout → 15% conversion lift ($500K impact)'
Better?"

You: "Perfect!"
```

**What you learned:** Metrics + impact > task descriptions

---
