# Session Summary: Testing & Git Workflow Standards

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Commit**: `334722f` (v0.2.0-community-schema)
**Status**: ✅ All systems functional and tested

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Testing Infrastructure (Vitest)
**Installed and configured:**
- Vitest (fast, modern test runner)
- @testing-library/react (component testing)
- @testing-library/jest-dom (DOM assertions)
- jsdom (DOM environment for tests)

**Test suite created:**
- 21 tests covering existing features
- 4 test files (API, components, database)
- All tests passing ✅

**Test scripts added:**
```bash
npm run test              # Watch mode (development)
npm run test:run          # Run once (CI/pre-commit)
npm run test:ui           # Visual test UI
npm run test:coverage     # Coverage report
```

**Files created:**
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `tests/setup.ts` - Test environment setup
- `tests/api/chat.test.ts` - Chat API tests
- `tests/api/resume.test.ts` - Resume API tests
- `tests/components/ChatInterface.test.tsx` - UI tests
- `tests/lib/db.test.ts` - Database model tests

---

### 2. Git Tagging Workflow

**Created comprehensive git workflow:**
- Every functional commit gets tagged
- Clear rollback strategy
- Pre-commit checklist enforced
- Semantic versioning with feature tags

**Documentation:**
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow guide
- Pre-commit checks standardized:
  ```bash
  npm run test:run && npm run type-check && npm run build
  ```

**Tag format:**
```
v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]-[FEATURE]
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Run checks
npm run test:run && npm run type-check && npm run build

# 2. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature"

# 3. Tag
git tag v0.3.0-feature-name

# 4. Push
git push origin main --tags
```

**First tagged commit created:**
- Tag: `v0.2.0-community-schema`
- All checks passed ✅
- Pushed to origin ✅

---

### 3. Updated Technical Specification

**Added new sections to TECHNICAL-SPEC.md:**

**🧪 Testing Strategy**
- Philosophy: Test what matters
- Testing stack documentation
- Test organization structure
- What to test (and what NOT to test)
- Coverage goals (pragmatic, not dogmatic)

**📦 Git Workflow & Tagging**
- Core principle explanation
- Functional commit definition
- Commit & tag workflow
- Quick rollback commands
- Why it matters

---

## 📊 Current Test Coverage

```
Test Files:  4 passed (4)
Tests:       21 passed (21)
Duration:    ~2.3s

Coverage Areas:
- ✅ Chat API functionality
- ✅ Resume upload/retrieval
- ✅ ChatInterface component
- ✅ Database models (all 9 models verified)
```

---

## 🎯 Development Standards Now Enforced

### Pre-Commit Requirements
Before EVERY commit:
1. ✅ Tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
2. ✅ TypeScript compiles (`npm run type-check`)
3. ✅ Build succeeds (`npm run build`)

If any fail → don't commit, fix first.

### Commit Standards
- Use conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `db:`, etc.)
- Include "Tested:" section explaining what was verified
- Be descriptive but concise

### Tagging Standards
- Tag EVERY functional commit on main
- Use semantic versioning with feature descriptors
- Push tags with commits (`git push origin main --tags`)

---

## 🔄 Rollback Capability

**Now you can instantly rollback to any working state:**

```bash
# List all tagged states
git tag -l

# View details
git show v0.2.0-community-schema

# Rollback (soft - just checkout)
git checkout v0.2.0-community-schema

# Rollback (hard - reset main)
git reset --hard v0.2.0-community-schema
```

**Current timeline:**
- `v0.2.0-community-schema` - Database + testing infrastructure ✅ (Oct 16)
- (Previous commits untagged - can tag retroactively if needed)

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `tests/setup.ts`
- `tests/api/chat.test.ts`
- `tests/api/resume.test.ts`
- `tests/components/ChatInterface.test.tsx`
- `tests/lib/db.test.ts`
- `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
- `TECHNICAL-SPEC.md`
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

**Modified:**
- `package.json` (added test scripts)
- `package-lock.json` (new dependencies)

---

## 🚀 What This Enables

### Confidence
- Every commit is verified working
- No "did this break something?" anxiety
- Clear evidence tests pass

### Speed
- Fast rollback to any working state
- No lengthy debugging of "what changed?"
- Clear project timeline via tags

### Quality
- Forced to think before committing
- Tests catch regressions immediately
- TypeScript catches type errors

### Collaboration
- Clear expectations for contributors
- Easy to review changes (tagged milestones)
- Safe to experiment (can always rollback)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Ready to Continue)

With testing and git workflow established, we're ready to implement features:

1. **Add private/public toggle to chat** (v0.3.0-public-toggle)
2. **Update chat API** for mode handling
3. **Build community feed page** (v0.4.0-community-feed)
4. **Build thread view page** (v0.5.0-thread-view)
5. **Add voting system** (v0.6.0-voting)
6. **Expert validation** (v0.7.0-validation)
7. **Claude + RAG** (v0.8.0-rag)

Each will be:
- Tested before commit ✅
- Tagged when functional ✅
- Rollback-able if needed ✅

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Testing Philosophy
**"Test what matters, not everything"**
- Focus on critical paths (auth, chat, payments)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Mock external services (OpenAI, Stripe)
- Don't test styling or third-party libraries

### Git Workflow Philosophy
**"Every functional commit is a checkpoint"**
- Only commit when everything works
- Tag immediately after commit
- Never leave main in a broken state
- Use tags for quick navigation

---

## ✅ Verification

**Run these to verify current state:**

```bash
# Tests
npm run test:run
# ✅ Expected: 21 tests pass

# Type checking
npm run type-check
# ✅ Expected: No errors

# Build
npm run build
# ✅ Expected: Build succeeds

# Git status
git status
# ✅ Expected: Working tree clean

# Tags
git tag -l
# ✅ Expected: v0.2.0-community-schema
```
